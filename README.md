 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
 Project Title: Aurelia - Elegant Home Decor E-Commerce Store
Project Overview
Aurelia is a fully responsive, front-end e-commerce web application designed for a high-end home decor brand. Built using HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, the application functions as a Single Page Application (SPA). It allows users to browse products, filter by categories, view detailed product specifications, and manage a shopping cart without ever reloading the page, ensuring a smooth and immersive user experience.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to simulate a premium online shopping environment while demonstrating advanced front-end development techniques without reliance on a backend framework. It showcases:

Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Rendering products and updating UI elements via JavaScript.

State Management: Handling the shopping cart data, totals, and user interactions locally.

Responsive UI/UX: utilizing Tailwind CSS to create a design that adapts to mobile and desktop screens, enhanced with custom CSS animations.

Key Features
1. Seamless Navigation (SPA Architecture)
No Page Reloads: The site uses JavaScript to toggle between views (Home, Products, About, Contact, Cart), creating an instant, app-like feel.

Active State Highlighting: Navigation links automatically update to reflect the current section.

Sticky Header: The navigation bar remains accessible at the top of the viewport while scrolling.

2. Dynamic Product Catalog
JSON-based Data: Products are loaded dynamically from a structured JavaScript array (simulating a database).

Category Filtering: Users can filter products by categories (Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom, Decor) with instant visual updates.

Real-time Search: A search bar allows users to filter products by name instantly as they type.

3. Interactive Product Details
Quick View Modal: Clicking on a product opens a detailed pop-up overlay (modal) containing:

High-quality imagery.

Dynamic price calculation (showing discount percentages and savings).

Star rating visualization generated via SVGs.

Color variant selection.

Detailed specifications and descriptions.

4. Functional Shopping Cart System
Add-to-Cart Logic: Users can add items from the main grid or the modal.

Dynamic Cart Management:

Real-time updates to the cart counter badge in the navbar.

"Remove Item" functionality within the cart view.

Automatic calculation of the subtotal.

Empty State Handling: Displays a "Start Shopping" call-to-action when the cart is empty.

5. User Interface Enhancements & Animations
Custom Animations: Features smooth fade-in page transitions, a "Ken Burns" zoom effect on the hero image, and staggered entry animations for product cards.

Toast Notifications: A custom, non-intrusive popup appears at the bottom of the screen to confirm actions (e.g., "Item added to cart").

Responsive Design: Optimized layouts for mobile devices (stacked grids) and desktops (multi-column grids).

Tech Stack
Structure: HTML5

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) + Custom CSS

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Typography: Google Fonts (Cormorant Garamond & Lato)

Icons: Heroicons (SVG)
